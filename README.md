# Quit

Our vision was to create an app to help smokers **Quit** smoking by commiting to a challenge.
The user will enter his/her name, the amount of cigarettes smoked per day and the price of the cigarette pack.
With these inputs provided by the user we are able to calculate how many days has passed since the challenge started, how many cigarettes that has not been smoked and how much money the user is saving!

Our goal is that the users of **Quit** should feel motivated to commit to a smoke free life!
